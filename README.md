# First Platformer Game

This is my first 2D platformer game made with the Godot Engine. It is not a full game but a prototype and has no winning condition or main menu, just the gameplay.

## Features
- Basic platformer functionality
- Simple animations
- Coin collection
- Enemy (slime) avoidance
- Falling off the world

## About
I created this game by following a tutorial from Brackeys. The assets used in this game are free assets shared by Brackeys.

## Assets
